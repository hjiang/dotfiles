## Introduction

This is my personal configuration file for macOS and Linux.

## How to use

Run `make download-assets` to download 3rd-party assets (cursor themes, etc.).

Run `make install` to create symlinks in `$HOME`.

Run `make uninstall` to remove the symlinks.

## Directory structure

The `shared` directory contains files common to all my computers.

The other directories are hostnames and contain files specific to each computer.
